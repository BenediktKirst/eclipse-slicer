There are currently no coding guidelines in place you have to follow.

However, in order to make everyone's life easier **please** change at least the following settings for your Eclipse plugin development environment:

Go to `Window > Preferences > General > Workspace`.
* Change `Text file encoding` to `UTF-8`.
* Change `New text file line delimiter` to `Unix`.

Go to `Window > Preferences > General > Editors > Text Editors`.
* Check `Insert spaces for tabs`.
* Set `Display tab width` to `4`. (This should be the default value.)

Go to `Window > Preferences > Java > Save Actions`.
* Check `Perform the selected actions on save`.
* Check `Organize imports`.
* Check `Additional actions`.
  * Select `Configure.... > Code Organizing`.
  * Check `Remove trailing whitespace` + `All lines`.

> Thank you!
